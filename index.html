                <p>Barbie's First Feature Length Film</p>

                <p> Barbie's first feature length film was "Barbie in the Nutcracker".
                    This sparked decades of iconic films such as my personal favorites, 
                    "Barbie as Princess and the Pauper" (2004) and "Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses" (2006).

                <p>Pregnant Midge</p>

                <p> This is my favorite controversial doll in the series.
                    The Happy Family doll, commonly refered to as "Pregnant Midge",
                    was released in 2002 and sparked much controversy.
                    Because the doll was packaged alone and without family members, parents complained the doll sent the wrong message.

                <p>Barbie Becomes a Computer Engineer</p>

                <p> One of my favorite dolls is 2010's Computer Engineer Barbie.
                    This is a very special doll for me because I too am a woman in STEM!
                    Female engineers from the Society of Women Engineers and National academy of Engineering were consulted on her wardrobe and work.
                    I appreciate the feminine details such as her pink laptop and phone, pink wedges, and her t-shirt which has "Barbie" spelled in binary code.

                <h3 class="event2">2016</h3>
                <p>Barbie Introduces new body types</p>

                <p> In 2016 Barbie introduced three new body types: curvy, petite, and tall.
                    After much backlash concerning Barbie's thin body, Mattel decided to launch the new bodies to promote body positivity.
                    This change landed Barbie on the cover of TIME Magazine!
