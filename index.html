                <p > Ruth Handler cofounded Mattel with her husband Elliot.
                    She noticed that there were many toys for boys, but not many for girls.
                    On a trip to Germany, Ruth found the Bild Lili doll which inspired her to create Barbie.

                <p> The first celebrity doll was British fashion model Twiggy.
                    This is an important moment in Barbie history, since it marks the begining of the brand's status in

                <p> The 1970's hold the most iconic dolls in Barbie history.
                    Malibu Barbie was the first major change to the doll.
                    For the first time in over ten years, Barbie had a new face.
                    Instead of a cold side-eye, Malibu Barbie looked straight forward and smiled!

                <p> Another iconic doll is 1977's Superstar Barbie.
                    She wore an incredible hot pink, satin gown.
                    Although on the outside she doesn't seem too special, Superstar Barbie perfectly represents the
                    brand's glamour and elegance.

                    Totally Hair Barbie is the best-selling Barbie doll to date.

                    The Happy Family doll, commonly refered to as "Pregnant Midge",
                    was released in 2002 and sparked much controversy.
                    Because the doll was packaged alone and without family members, parents complained the doll sent the
                    wrong message.

                    Female engineers from the Society of Women Engineers and National academy of Engineering were
                    consulted on her wardrobe and work.
                    I appreciate the feminine details such as her pink laptop and phone, pink wedges, and her t-shirt
                    which has "Barbie" spelled in binary code.

                <p> In 2016 Barbie introduced three new body types: curvy, petite, and tall.
                    After much backlash concerning Barbie's thin body, Mattel decided to launch the new bodies to
                    promote body positivity.
                    This change landed Barbie on the cover of TIME Magazine!
